#### Reflections on Mini Dragon’s Den at Surrey

Last month end, I had the chance to pitch **FlourishLifeTech** again at the Mini Dragon’s Den in Surrey. It was an energizing experience where I felt confident and happy presenting my vision.

Through the process, I gained a lot more clarity about how my business model has evolved so far. I also discovered frameworks that can help me fill the gaps in between the Lean Canvas such as the Flourishing Business Model, ECG for the common good, and the Impact Canvas by Cosmic Gold. These are already helping me shape FlourishLifeTech in a more holistic way.

## What I Learned

One of my biggest lessons was around **time management**. I went overtime with my pitch, partly because I had too many slides and hadn’t practiced enough within the strict time limit. I only rehearsed once at Toastmasters, where I felt very supported by my group. During the pitch, I had to skip many slides to stay on track.

Another learning was about **visual communication**. With only five minutes, there simply isn’t enough time for people to read through detailed slides. I realized it works best when there’s more visuals rather than text-heavy content.

## Observations from Others

I enjoyed several of the other presentations. One interesting observation was that entrepreneurs working in art-based ventures tended to include fewer financial statements compared to those from more traditional business backgrounds. This reminded me that different mindsets and priorities shape how people present their ideas.

## Pivots and Next Steps

### Finding My Ideal Clients

I know I need more clarity around identifying my ideal clients. Alongside that, I want to deepen the idea of **FlourishCommons**—a concept that feels central to my mission. Since the pitch, I’ve found some wonderful resources to help build a business model around this vision.

I also recognize the importance of connecting with communities already working on regeneration and decentralization of the commons, such as DAO and Web3 networks. These are places where I can both learn and contribute.

### Regeneration and Mentorship

Regeneration speaks very closely to my heart. My journey through regenerative finance and systems thinking has shaped not only my worldview but also my work with FlourishLifeTech. To move forward, I know I need the right **mentor in the regenerative field**—someone who can guide me through the complexities while staying true to the values of renewal, cooperation, and stewardship of the commons.

## Mindset

For me, there’s no sense of “winner” or “loser” in experiences like the Mini Dragon’s Den. I don’t really resonate with the logic of competition in a world where cooperation is so urgently needed. Every time I present FlourishLifeTech, I see it as a step forward in collaboration, learning, and shaping the future of the commons.

## Gratitude

I really appreciate the efforts of the team at **DiverseCity**. They have been generous with their time, support, and efforts. I am always amazed by how hard they work to keep us dedicated to our missions. I feel deeply grateful for their encouragement and commitment to helping entrepreneurs like me grow and flourish.
