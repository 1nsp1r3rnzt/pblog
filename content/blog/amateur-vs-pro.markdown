Steven Pressfield is a profilic writer. I loved two of his books, 'war of art' and 'do the work'.

He writes in a poetic manner which makes it less practical. This post is an attempt towards synthesizing my understanding of `what is a pro`. 

Simply put, a professional is the one with `professional habits`.

The war for a professional is not with external circumstances but internal which he names as `resistance`.


## The Professional is someone who 
  - Is Patient
  - Seeks order
  - Demystifies
  - Acts in the face of fear
  - Accepts no excuses
  - Plays it as it lays
  - Is prepared
  - Does not show off
  - Dedicates himself to mastering technique
  - Does not hesitate to ask for help
  - Does not take failure or success personally
  - Does not identify with his or her instrument/work
  - Endures adversity
  - Self-validates
  - Reinvents herself
  - Is recognized by other professionals




## Amateur vs Professional Habits
> “The amateur tweets. The pro works.”


I have created a cheat-sheet based on the books.

## Remember on days when Resistance is really strong:

1. Take what you can get and stay patient. The defense may crack late in the game.
2. Play for tomorrow.
3. We’re in this for the long haul.
