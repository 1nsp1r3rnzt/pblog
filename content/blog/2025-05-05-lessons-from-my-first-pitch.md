On May 3rd, I had the opportunity to pitch **FlourishLifeTech** at the DiverseCity Mini-Dragons’ Den in Surrey, alongside 20 other inspiring entrepreneurs. Our company helps personal growth professionals digitize their tools and offerings and this was our first time pitching in a competition.

## Here’s What I Took Away from My First Pitch Competition


### What Went Well
I managed my time reasonably well and stayed composed through the Q&A. I showed up with clarity, and that helped me stay grounded and present.

### What I Could Improve
There’s still work to do—especially on the UX of our product demo and the visual presentation of our slides. I learned how crucial early feedback is (thank you everyone!) and how much polish can impact how your vision lands.

### Challenges and Emotions
Condensing a complex idea into 5 minutes was no small feat. I walked away with a mix of feeling proud that I still showed up fully and disappointment that I missed taking feedback on the slides. The feedback I received from other participants helped turn that disappointment into motivation.

### Key Learnings
* **Clear storytelling > perfect slides**
* **Confidence grows from deep clarity**
* **My audience is more niche than I realized and that’s a good thing**
* **Engagement matters:** Next time, I’ll aim to connect more directly with the audience and ask a question!

### The Outcome
I didn’t win the pitch competition but I *did* win something more valuable: clarity, direction, and community. Huge thanks to the organizers for the opportunity and Jason Wong for the feedback.

### What’s Next
I’m now focusing on validating the idea further, co-creating with early users, and evolving FlourishLifeTech into something truly impactful. The vision to bridge systems thinking, regenerative design, and tech for personal growth still lights me up!

### Gratitude
Thanks to everyone who offered feedback, especially my classmates and Florence, who made the event run smoothly.

### Final Thoughts
If you can align your passion, the problem you want to solve, and a solution that truly helps people—you’ve already won.
