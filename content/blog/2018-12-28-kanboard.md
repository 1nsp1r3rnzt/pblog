Kanboard is an open-source kanban based software. It is minimalistic in design with a lot of plugins available. 
I have used Kanboard for a week and found it to be useful for the side projects.
Comparing to Trello, it does not provide much out-of-the box extensibility, but gets the work done. 
Also, There is [wekan](https://wekan.github.io/) which is an open-source clone of Trello.

Kanboard is based on PHP and can use sqlite as the backend.
# Installation
Installing it on Raspberry Pi is a breeze.
I used `nginx` server.

1. Download the folder from the [latest release](https://github.com/kanboard/kanboard/releases)
2. Follow the [installation process](https://docs.kanboard.org/en/latest/admin_guide/installation.html)
3. unzip the folder
4. you need to use correct permissions for the `data` direcotry
5. browse to the url
6. The default username is `admin` and password is `admin`
It has an active community and at v1.2.7 at the time of post.

## UI 

The UI is minimalistic. I would say it is bare and bones.
You can install themes like `nebula` or `oxygen`.

It lets you import issue details from Github issues through a plugin.
Also, [Toggl](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/toggl-button-productivity/oejgccbfbmkkpaidnkphaiaecficdnfn?hl=en) button provides seamless integration with Kanboard.

There are categories and tag to sort the issues. You can define `WIP` limit in the swim lanes.
It allows attachments and comments along with time tracking for billing.


## Conclusion
Kanboard is light weight on resources and useful for project which don't need collaboration.
