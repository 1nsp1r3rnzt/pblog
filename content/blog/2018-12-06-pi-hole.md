Pi-Hole is a DNS sink server which blocks ads and malware based on the DNS resolution. It is light on resources and can be installed in Raspberry Pi. By default; it installs Lighttpd. If you use Nginx, you need to change settings as both servers can't run on the same port.

It allows to select a DNS upstream from a bunch of DNS servers. The DNS queries are cached and served from the cache next time. 

Here is the interface of Pi-Hole

The red tile on the right side shows a number of block sites.



## Blocking websites

Luckily, there are people at [blocklist.site](https://blocklist.site/app/) and [firebog](https://firebog.net/) who constantly update the hosts lists. Also, the [forum](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/)for Pi-Hole has great resources and discussion about hosts lists. For blocking sites, You need to enter the URL of the hosts file in the `Settings>BlockLists`

You can also build your custom block list and paste the URL in the same settings.

## Performance



The total blocked domain are `2,442,082`.

It slowed Raspberry Pi 3B+ a bit. The Raspberry Pi 3B+ is also serving a private wiki which takes time to serve pages.


## Needs UBlock for a perfect Solution

Pi-Hole a DNS based blocker so websites serving ads from the same host are not blocked. Honestly, I use it to be safe from malware, fake news, and ransom ware websites. It serves its purpose well.



Rest, UBlock completes the need for a per site filter and blocker.

## Result

well, I was not astonished to see Microsoft on the top of blocked list. It sent the highest number of requests.

`Snapdeal's` android app went on a connection request spree as it could not connect its home server. It sent `4089` requests within a couple of hours.



Overall, Pi-Hole is actively developed and is stable to use.
