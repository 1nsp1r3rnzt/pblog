After exploring Systems thinking, I am trying to build a robust habit tracking system which is flexible to modify and can show the lag and lead measure habits.

Previously, i have tried Loop habit tracker but found it inflexible.

I found Google sheets to be excellent for this purpose.

## Features
  - There are two types of habits to track.
    - 1.Binary habits
      - Habits with a simple check-box. 
    - 2. Metrics
        + Any habit that is a quantifiable (Number of units)
      - Number of push-ups in a day.   
      - Pomodoros in a day.
  * A way to track progress.
      - Each habits needs `a number of days` per week.
      - A `Daily dashboard` to show today's progress.
        - show `Total habits completed`
        - show `total metric completed`  
      - A `weekly review dashboard` which shows the lagging habits.
